# adobe-conversion
This is the result of the conversion from PDF to HTML using Adobe Acrobat

There are four folders:
1. approved_doc
2. circular_accessibility
3. firecode
4. cleaned_html

The first three items contain the original PDF document and the raw converted documents. The main html file is the `content.htm`.

The `cleaned_html` folder contains two things:
1. an iPython notebook script to clean and extract the `body` tag from the converted html.
2. the cleaned and extracted `body` html code.
